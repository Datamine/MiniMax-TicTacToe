# MiniMax TicTacToe

An improved version of a TicTacToe game I built for an AI/ML class back in Spring 2013.

Input: a pair of coordinates (x,y) where (0,0) is the bottom left corner and (2,2) is the top right.

Run with `python TicTacToe.py.` Written in Python 2.7.10 and requires only the standard library.

I could've made this neater (e.g. written in curses for a better interface), but the point of this program
was the minimax algorithm, not the cosmetics.
