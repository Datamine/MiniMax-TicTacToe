# MiniMax TicTacToe

An improved version of a TicTacToe game I built for an AI/ML class back in Spring 2013.

Run with `python TicTacToe.py.` Written in Python 2.7.10 and requires only the standard library.

I could've made this neater (e.g. written in curses for a better interface), but the point of this program
was the minimax algorithm, not the cosmetics. 

ToDo: add alpha-beta pruning (e.g. for symmetry) to improve performance.
